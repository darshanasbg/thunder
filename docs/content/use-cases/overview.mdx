# Use Cases

Thunder supports multiple identity patterns, from consumer applications to enterprise SaaS and AI agents. This section helps you choose a starting point and then move to implementation guides.

## Available Patterns

- **[Consumer Applications (B2C)](/docs/use-cases/b2c/customer-identity)**: Build low-friction sign-up and sign-in journeys for public users.
- **[SaaS Applications (B2B)](/docs/use-cases/b2b/multi-tenant-saas)**: Add organizations, invitations, and enterprise single sign-on (SSO).
- **[AI Agents and MCP](/docs/use-cases/ai-agents/agent-authentication)**: Secure agent-to-platform and user-to-agent access.

## Shared Building Blocks

Most use cases reuse these Thunder capabilities:

- Flow orchestration for sign-in, sign-up, and recovery.
- Passwordless methods such as passkeys and magic links.
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for app and API access.
- SDKs and APIs for both hosted and custom user interfaces.
