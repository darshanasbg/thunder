# Customer Identity for B2C Applications

Choose this pattern when your users are individual consumers who expect fast onboarding and simple sign-in across web and mobile applications.

## Typical Requirements

- Support social, password, and passwordless sign-in options.
- Keep registration short and progressively collect profile data.
- Add step-up authentication only for high-risk actions.
- Provide reliable account recovery paths.

## Recommended Baseline Flow

1. Start with email or social registration.
2. Add passkey registration during onboarding or first successful sign-in.
3. Use passkey-first sign-in with fallback to password or magic link.
4. Trigger step-up authentication for sensitive operations.
5. Offer recovery through verified email channels.
