# Multi-Tenant SaaS Identity (B2B)

Use this pattern when your platform serves customer organizations and each organization needs an isolated workspace with
controlled access.

## Use Case Scope

The SaaS platform must provide identity, access control, and governance for multiple customer organizations, where each
organization operates in an isolated workspace.

## Organization Onboarding and Authentication

The first interaction in the SaaS application must onboard a new customer by completing two mandatory actions in a
single flow:

1. Register the user in the platform.
2. Create a dedicated workspace for that user and assign them as the workspace owner.

User registration must support:

- Email with OTP or password
- Google authentication
- GitHub authentication

For operational integrations, the platform must expose organization lifecycle events, including workspace creation
status, so internal and third-party systems can synchronize and provision related data.

Workspace administrator authentication must include:

- Secure login with email and OTP or password
- OAuth login through Google and GitHub
- Login failure tracking
- Secure session management

## Organization-Level User Management

The platform must allow workspace owners and administrators to:

- Send team invitations by email
- Assign roles during invitation or onboarding

The platform must ensure invited users:

- Become platform users with access only to the specific workspace
- Be blocked from accessing other workspaces

Invitation management must support:

- Invitation expiry
- Invitation revocation by the inviter

## Workspace Authorization and Subscription Controls

Each workspace must enforce role-based access control:

- Roles define permission scopes
- The platform enforces permissions at both API and UI levels
- Only authorized users can perform privileged actions

Each workspace must be linked to a subscription tier. The tier must control:

- Feature availability
- Usage limits
- API access constraints

When a workspace subscription changes, the platform must update authorization and entitlements dynamically based on the
new tier.

## API Access Enforcement

Every API request must pass authentication and authorization checks. Authorization must validate:

- User identity
- Workspace membership
- Role permissions
- Subscription tier

The platform must reject unauthorized access attempts.

## Platform Monitoring and Governance

The platform must provide platform administrators with a cross-workspace dashboard that includes:

- Total organization registrations
- Monthly active users (MAU)
- Authentication attempts
- Login failures
- Workspace growth trends

The platform must allow platform administrators to govern customer workspaces by:

- Viewing all registered workspaces
- Viewing workspace metadata
- Monitoring workspace activity indicators
- Deactivating workspaces

When a workspace is deactivated, the platform must prevent users in that workspace from:

- Logging in
- Accessing APIs
- Using the platform
