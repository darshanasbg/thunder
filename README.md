  ```bash
  https://localhost:8090/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=client123&redirect_uri=https://localhost:3000&scope=openid&state=state_1
  ```

- Enter the credentials of the user you created in the first step.

- After successful authentication, you will be redirected to the redirect URI with the authorization code and state.

  ```bash
  https://localhost:3000/?code=<code>&state=state_1
  ```

- Copy the authorization code and exchange it for an access token using the following cURL command:

  ```bash
  curl -k -X POST 'https://localhost:8090/oauth2/token' \
  -u 'client123:secret123' \
  -d 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
  -d 'redirect_uri=https://localhost:3000' \
  -d 'code=<code>'
  ```

  - **Client ID:** `client123`
  - **Client Secret:** `secret123`

#### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Try SMS OTP Login

SMS One-Time Password (OTP) authentication allows users to authenticate using a one-time code sent to their mobile number. Prior to using SMS OTP, you need to configure a message provider to send SMS messages. Follow the steps below to set up SMS OTP authentication.

##### Step 1: Configure a Message Provider

Configure a message provider to send SMS messages. You can use services like Twilio, Vonage, or a custom service of your choice.

```bash
curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/notification-senders/message \
-d '{
  "name": "Custom SMS Sender",
  "description": "Sender for sending SMS messages",
  "provider": "custom",
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "url",
      "value": "<custom_sms_provider_url>",
    },
    {
      "name": "http_method",
      "value": "POST"
    },
    {
      "name": "content_type",
      "value": "JSON"
    }
  ]
}'
```

> Note: Refer [Message Provider Configuration Guide](/docs/content/configure-message-providers.md) for more details on configuring message providers.

##### Step 2: Update SMS OTP Flow Configuration

Update the `senderName` property in the `auth_flow_config_sms` flow definition to use your configured message sender.

##### Step 3: Configure Application to Use SMS OTP Flow

Update the system application to use the SMS OTP authentication flow template:

```bash
curl -kL -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/applications/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 \
--data '{
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "name": "Test SPA",
    "description": "Initial testing App",
    "client_id": "client123",
    "client_secret": "***",
    "callback_url": [
        "https://localhost:3000"
    ],
    "supported_grant_types": [
        "client_credentials",
        "authorization_code"
    ],
    "auth_flow_graph_id": "auth_flow_config_sms"
}'
```

##### Step 4: Create a User with Mobile Number

Create a user with a `mobileNumber` attribute to receive SMS OTP:

```bash
curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/users \
-d '{
    "organizationUnit": "456e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
    "type": "superhuman",
    "attributes": {
        "username": "thor",
        "password": "thor123",
        "email": "thor@thunder.sky",
        "firstName": "Thor",
        "lastName": "Odinson",
        "age": 1534,
        "abilities": [
            "strength",
            "speed",
            "healing"
        ],
        "address": {
            "city": "Asgard",
            "zip": "00100"
        },
        "mobileNumber": "+94xxxxxxxxx"
    }
}'
```

##### Step 5: Try Out SMS OTP Authentication

- Initiate the authentication flow with your application ID:

  ```bash
  curl -kL -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/flow/execute \
  -d '{
      "applicationId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  }'
  ```

  You'll receive a response with a flow ID and username input request.

- Provide the username to continue the flow:

  ```bash
  curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/flow/execute \
  -d '{
      "flowId": "<flow_id>",
      "inputs": {
          "username": "thor"
      }
  }'
  ```

  An OTP will be sent to the user's mobile number.

- Complete authentication by providing the OTP:

  ```bash
  curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/flow/execute \
  -d '{
      "flowId": "<flow_id>",
      "inputs": {
          "otp": "696546"
      }
  }'
  ```

- If the OTP is valid, you will receive a response with the auth assertion.

              "zip": "00100"
          }
      }
  }'
  ```

- Create an application or update the existing system default application to use the basic auth login template. You can use the following cURL command to update the default application.

  ```bash
  curl -kL -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/applications/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000' \
  --data '{
      "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "name": "Test SPA",
      "description": "Initial testing App",
      "client_id": "client123",
      "client_secret": "***",
      "callback_url": [
          "https://localhost:3000"
      ],
      "supported_grant_types": [
          "client_credentials",
          "authorization_code"
      ],
      "auth_flow_graph_id": "auth_flow_config_basic"
  }'
  ```

- Start login flow for the application with the following cURL command:

  ```bash
  curl -kL -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/flow/execute \
  -d '{
      "applicationId": "<application_id>"
  }'
  ```

  You'll receive a response similar to the following:

  ```json
  {
      "flowId": "db93a19e-c23f-4cfc-a45f-0e0bc157f6d5",
      "flowStatus": "PROMPT_ONLY",
      "type": "VIEW",
      "data": {
        "inputs": [
          {
              "name": "username",
              "type": "string",
              "required": true
          },
          {
              "name": "password",
              "type": "string",
              "required": true
          }
        ]
      }
  }
  ```

- Make the second cURL request to complete the login flow. Make sure to replace `<flow_id>` with the `flowId` received in the previous response. Also, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials of the user you created in the first step.

  ```bash
  curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/flow/execute \
  -d '{
      "flowId": "<flow_id>",
      "inputs": {
          "username": "thor",
          "password": "thor123"
      }
  }'
  ```

- If the login is successful, you will receive a response with the auth assertion.

      ],
      "supported_grant_types": [
          "client_credentials",
          "authorization_code"
      ],
      "auth_flow_graph_id": "auth_flow_config_google"
  }'
  ```

- Start login flow for the application with the following cURL command:

  ```bash
  curl -kL -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/flow/execute \
  -d '{
      "applicationId": "<application_id>"
  }'
  ```

  You'll receive a response similar to the following:

<summary><h3>üóÑÔ∏è Running with PostgreSQL Database</h3></summary>

#### üîß Step 1: Start PostgreSQL

- Create a Docker container for PostgreSQL with `thunderdb` database.

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=asgthunder \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=asgthunder \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=thunderdb \
    postgres
  ```

- Create the `runtimedb` in the same PostgreSQL container.

  ```bash
  docker exec -it postgres psql -U asgthunder -d thunderdb -c "CREATE DATABASE runtimedb;"
  ```

#### üóÇ Step 2: Initialize the Database

- Populate the `thunderdb` database with the required tables and data.

  ```bash
  docker exec -i postgres psql -U asgthunder -d thunderdb < backend/dbscripts/thunderdb/postgres.sql
  ```

- Populate the `runtimedb` database with the required tables and data.

  ```bash
  docker exec -i postgres psql -U asgthunder -d thunderdb < backend/dbscripts/runtimedb/postgres.sql
  ```

#### üõ† Step 3: Configure Thunder to Use PostgreSQL

1. Open the `backend/cmd/server/repository/conf/deployment.yaml` file.
2. Update the `database` section to point to the PostgreSQL database:
```yaml
database:
  identity:
    type: "postgres"
    hostname: "localhost"
    port: 5432
    name: "thunderdb"
    username: "asgthunder"
    password: "asgthunder"
    sslmode: "disable"
  runtime:
    type: "postgres"
    hostname: "localhost"
    port: 5432
    name: "runtimedb"
    username: "asgthunder"
    password: "asgthunder"
    sslmode: "disable"
```

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 4: Run the Product

   ```bash
   make run
   ```

The product will now use the PostgreSQL database for its operations.
